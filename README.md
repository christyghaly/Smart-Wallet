📌 Project Overview
This project is a banking system that allows clients to manage their accounts through a server-client architecture. Clients can perform various transactions, and the server maintains records for each account.

🖥️ Server Data Management
The server handles client data by creating and managing the following files:

1️⃣ Files Created by the Server:

📂 accountfile.dat → A binary file storing all account details.
📂 allaccount.txt → A text file containing account data, readable by server owners.
📂 Transaction Files → Each client has a unique text file storing their transaction history.
File Naming Convention: (Last two digits of National ID) + "" + (Account Number)_
2️⃣ Account Number Management:

Account numbers are generated sequentially.
Used account numbers are stored in a map to prevent duplication.
3️⃣ Auto-Generated Accounts:

If a user requests their balance and no account is found, a new account with zero balance is automatically created.
4️⃣ Supported Transactions:

✅ Deposit money
✅ Withdraw money
✅ Pay telephone bills
✅ Donate to charities
✅ Check account balance
